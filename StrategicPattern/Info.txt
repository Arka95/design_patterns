WHY STRATEGIC DESIGN IS IMPORTANT:

suppose you have a movie hall and it has findSeatAndBookTicket() fn whih applies different strategies in 
finding seat based on MovieHall(conf) constructor's conf. Instead of adding boilerplates like multiple 
confditional statements in the Class, better to have multiple fundtional classes assocuited with it, each
overriding the  findSeatAndBookTicket() function. Then runtime polymorphism will determine which function class'
method is invoked, instead of adding multiple if conditions
