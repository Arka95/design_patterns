WHY FLYWEIGHT DESIGN IS IMPORTANT:

`lift the load only when you need to.`

No point in loading the copies of the same object when just a ref does the trick. useful in  battle simuation games!
if its just a single object with multipleconcurent states, initialize a singleton and keep the state separate.
