WHY SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY DESIGN IS IMPORTANT:

`There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.
In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.`


In this context, a responsibility is considered to be one reason to change. 
This principle states that if we have 2 reasons to change for a class, we have to split the functionality in two classes.
